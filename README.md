# Phantis

Commander Serena's mission is to rescue her partner captured on Moon 4 of the SOTPOK System, better known as the world of PHANTIS, an unusual place inhabited by hostile fauna and exuberant flora.

## English Patch
English Patch for original CPC Spanish release of Phantis (a.k.a. Game Over II.)


- Replaces *FASE-* graphic.
- Changes item names to Game Over II names.
- UI titles adapted to English equivalent: "PUNTOS=SCORE, DERECHE=RIGHT, etc..."

### Notes:

In future, I would like to change the keybindings for setting the keyboard and starting the game but that's currently above my paygrade.

## Installation...

To install this patch you will need to apply the IPS file provided to your copy of Phantis using an IPS utility such as **Lunar IPS.**
