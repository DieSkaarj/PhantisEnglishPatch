# PhantisEnglishPatch
English Patch for original CPC Spanish release of Phantis (a.k.a. Game Over II.)


- Replaces *FASE-* graphic.
- Changes item names to Game Over II names.
- UI titles adapted to English equivalent: "PUNTOS=SCORE, DERECHE=RIGHT, etc..."

## Notes:

In future, I would like to change the keybindings for setting the keyboard and starting the game but that's currently above my paygrade.
